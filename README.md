# Autolab Self-Service Portal

The Autolab Self-Service Portal is a web application that integrates the Autolab API and UB databases to provide additional functionality that doesn't belong in Autolab's core.

Its primary features include:

- Allowing instructors to [create their own Autolab courses](https://napps.cse.buffalo.edu/docs/autolab/Getting%20started#create-a-course)
- [Assigning graders](https://napps.cse.buffalo.edu/docs/autolab/Grader%20Assignment%20Tool) to students randomly without creating conflicts of interest
- Defining [UB Course Sections](https://napps.cse.buffalo.edu/docs/autolab/UB%20course%20sections) to apply different deadlines to different sections of a course

Documentation is available at <https://napps.cse.buffalo.edu/docs/autolab>
