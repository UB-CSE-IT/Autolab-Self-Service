# Autolab Self-Service Portal

The Autolab Self-Service Portal is a web application that integrates the Autolab API and UB databases to provide additional functionality that doesn't belong in Autolab's core.

Its primary features include:

- Allowing instructors to [create their own Autolab courses](https://github.com/UB-CSE-IT/Autolab-Public-Documentation/blob/main/Getting%20started.md#create-a-course)
- [Assigning graders](https://github.com/UB-CSE-IT/Autolab-Public-Documentation/blob/main/Grader%20Assignment%20Tool.md) to students randomly without creating conflicts of interest
- Defining [UB Course Sections](https://github.com/UB-CSE-IT/Autolab-Public-Documentation/blob/main/UB%20course%20sections.md) to apply different deadlines to different sections of a course
