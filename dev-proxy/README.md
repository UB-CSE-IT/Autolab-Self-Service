This is a quick proxy setup for development. It'll proxy /portal to the front end and /portal/api to the backend,
assuming both are running locally on your host.

On your host, Quasar should be serving the development frontend on port 9000
The backend should be running on port 5057

In your browser, connect to http://localhost:80/portal.
